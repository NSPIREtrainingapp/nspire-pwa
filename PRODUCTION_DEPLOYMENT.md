# NSPIRE Training PWA - Production Deployment Guide

### ✅ Configuration Status

- **Custom Fields**: All created and mapped ✅
- **Tags**: All created and configured ✅
- **Sync Schedule**: Weekly (perfect for annual subscriptions) ✅

## 📋 GHL Dashboard Configuration

### Custom Fields Created:
- `app_password` - Generated password for app access
- `app_user_id` - Unique identifier for the user
- `trial_start_date` - When trial period began
- `subscription_tier` - User's subscription level
- `app_last_login` - Last time user accessed the app
- `subscriber_number` - Sequential subscriber number

### Tags Created:
- `paid_subscriber` - Active paying customers
- `trial_active` - Users in trial period
- `trial_expired` - Trial users who haven't converted
- `standard_59` - $59.99 annual subscribers (current pricing)
- `legacy_39` - **CRITICAL**: $39.99 legacy subscribers locked for life

## 🎯 Production File Structure

```
RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION SETUP:
├── index.html          ← Rename index-test.html to this
├── manifest.json       ← Already configured
├── sw.js              ← Service worker for PWA
├── images/            ← Image assignments (618 total)
├── src/               ← Scoring engine
└── ...other files
```

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. File Preparation
```bash
# In your project directory:
copy index-test.html index.html
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)
1. Login to Netlify
2. Drag and drop your entire project folder
3. Set custom domain (if desired)
4. Enable HTTPS (automatic)
5. Configure PWA settings

### 3. App Store Preparation
Your PWA is already configured for app stores with:
- Proper manifest.json
- Service worker for offline capability
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Professional branding and icons

## 💰 Subscription Management

### How It Works:
1. **New Customer**: Add to GHL with `trial_active` tag
2. **Trial Period**: 14 days automatic access
3. **Conversion**: Change tag to `paid_subscriber`, add `standard_59` tag
4. **Renewal**: System automatically checks subscription status weekly

### Subscription Tiers:
- **Trial**: 14-day free access (tag: `trial_active`)
- **Standard**: $59.99/year (tags: `paid_subscriber` + `standard_59`)
- **Legacy**: $39.99/year **LOCKED FOR LIFE** (tags: `paid_subscriber` + `legacy_39`)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Legacy customers with `legacy_39` tag maintain $39.99 pricing for the lifetime of their account. This tag is essential for grandfathering existing customers and honoring lifetime pricing commitments.
